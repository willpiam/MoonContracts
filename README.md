# William Doyle's Lunar Contracts 

## Description

This is an NFT project all about the moon. Each token will display the current phase of the moon based on ON CHAIN data. 

## Definitions 
Synodic Month - Period of time it talks for one full moon cycle to complete. 29.53 days

Special Type Id - This references an index referencing the "version/mutation" of the minted token. 

Supply - The supply of this token as a whole is limited only by the number of "special types" I create and the supply limit I set for each. However, the supply of each "special type" is limited to the amount specified when the special type is created. The supply of special types zero, or the standard version, will be specified at the time of deployment.

Please note that I do plan on adding more special types in the future.
